            MetaBorrow serves as a multi chain renting protocol that lets you
            unlock the true potential of your in-game digital assets.

          <h5 className="">
            MetaBorrowâ€™s mission is to accelerate the transition of crypto and
            non-crypto games towards a decentralised future by lending and
            borrowing the gaming assets using the staking mechanisms.
          </h5>

          <h5 className="">
            MetaBorrow is committed to empowering the gaming experience by
            helping gamers generate income through their gaming assets and save
            money at the same time by letting gamers rent in-game assets instead
            of buying them.
